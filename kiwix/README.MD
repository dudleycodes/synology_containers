# Kiwix Server in Docker for Synology NAS

Kiwix Server, also known as Kiwix-serve, is a .zim compatible web server. It allows you to deliver .zim files over the
HTTP protocol within your local network. A .zim file is an archive created to store Wiki content offline. The ZIM
file format is an open file format that stores wiki content for offline usage. Itâ€™s primarily used to store the
contents of Wikipedia and other Wikimedia projects, including articles, full-text search indices, and auxiliary
files. The format is defined by the openZIM project, which also supports an open-source ZIM reader called Kiwix.

## Setup

Add one or more .zim files to the `./data` directory.
